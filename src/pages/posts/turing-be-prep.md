This is a video I made to help new back-end students prepare for module one with Turing's ruby-exercises repo.
I detail setting up RSpec, an overview of test-driven development, and the basics of problem-solving as a developer.

There are a ton of exercises available in that repo, and this video has everything students need to set themselves up for success in Mod1.
